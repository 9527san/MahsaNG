# What is the idea
- MahsaNG is client-side of project [Segaro_Dream](https://github.com/GFW-knocker/Segaro_Dream)
- MahsaNG is a decentralized non-profit vpn platform in which everyone can share their configs to help others
- Donated configs continuously monitored and redistributed to users based on clients feedback in each subnet-ip
- Our goal is to make a superior vpn platform which is free,stable,scalable,distributed & filter-resistant

# Difference to v2rayNG
- vpn providers can use ADS service to make income instead of direct sell
- everyone can share their unused vps bandwidth to help others
- prevent free configs to be stolen and reselled
- Automatic report for refining config collection at central servers
- DNS over HTTPS
- TLS Fragmentor
- HTTP & WS fake Host
- Rotating Configs
- Random Subdomain
- & much more ...

# build from source
- the code can NOT build standalone apk directly from source
- some parts of source used for encrypting config is closed to prevent leakage & thus reselling of donated configs
- classes responsible for authentication with [mahsa server](https://www.mahsaserver.com/) is also closed to prevent abusing of mahsa server
- all other technology used to bypass filtering is willingly published in [Mahsa Xray-Core](https://github.com/GFW-knocker/Xray-core) including but not limited to Wireguard Noise, Youtube Direct , TLS & HTTPS & DoH fragmentor & fake Host

# build NikaNG from source
- [NikaNG](https://github.com/mahsanet/NikaNG) is a fork of v2rayNG with [Mahsa Xray-core](https://github.com/GFW-knocker/Xray-core)
- its fully open souce and it can build by github action or locally
- if you are interested in Mahsa-core as a developer , NikaNG is for you.
- you need to place [libv2ray.aar](https://github.com/GFW-knocker/AndroidLibXrayLite) in v2rayng/apps/libs folder before compile
